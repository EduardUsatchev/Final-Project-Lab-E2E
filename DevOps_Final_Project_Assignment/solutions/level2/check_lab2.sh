# check_lab2.sh â€“ End-to-End (E2E) Check for Student Level 2 Lab (Helm, Git, CI/CD)
#
# This script verifies that all required mandatory files for Level 2 exist,
# including the Helm chart files and the bonus CI/CD workflow file (if provided).
# It renders the Helm chart to ensure required Helm metadata is present,
# ensures that a k3d cluster ("lab-cluster") and namespace ("devops-lab") exist,
# deploys the Helm chart, waits for the rollout to complete, and runs an end-to-end test.
#
# Mandatory files (must be present in the Level 2 folder):
#   - helm/sample-app/Chart.yaml
#   - helm/sample-app/values.yaml
#   - helm/sample-app/templates/deployment.yaml
#   - helm/sample-app/templates/service.yaml
#   - helm/sample-app/templates/_helpers.tpl    <-- Required for Helm metadata.
#
# Bonus file (optional but recommended):
#   - .github/workflows/ci-cd.yml
#     --> This file MUST contain "runs-on: self-hosted" and ideally include bonus features (e.g., "canary" or "rollback").
#
# Usage:
#   chmod +x check_lab2.sh
#   ./check_lab2.sh
