# DevOps Engineering Final Project â€“ Assignment Overview and Submission Instructions

## Project Narrative
In this final project, you will assume the role of a DevOps professional tasked with solving real-world challenges such as scaling applications, automating continuous integration and delivery, managing cloud infrastructure securely, and automating operations end-to-end. Your solution will be divided into five levels, each building upon the previous one, and each designed to prepare you for market-ready DevOps practices.

### Goal
Present a solution that addresses the identified challenges by:
- Designing a robust architecture diagram (using a tool like draw.io).
- Submitting a detailed technical solution that demonstrates your understanding of each technology and practice covered in the course.

## Assignment Levels

### **Level 1: Docker & Kubernetes**

**Objective:**
- Build a containerized application using Docker with a multi-stage Dockerfile.
- Deploy the application to a Kubernetes cluster (using k3d) with appropriate manifests.
- Optionally, implement bonus features such as a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) and a blue-green deployment.

**Mandatory Files to Submit:**
- `Dockerfile`  
  *(Defines the multi-stage build for your container.)*
- `app.py`  
  *(Your sample application code, e.g., a simple Flask app returning "Hello from Level 1 Sample App!")*
- `requirements.txt`  
  *(Lists your Python dependencies. Please pin versions, e.g., `Flask==2.0.3` and `Werkzeug==2.0.3`.)*
- `deployment.yaml`  
  *(Kubernetes deployment manifest that references the local image `sample-app:latest`, with `imagePullPolicy: Never` and a readiness probe.)*
- `service.yaml`  
  *(Kubernetes service manifest exposing your application.)*

**Bonus Files (Optional):**
- `hpa.yaml`  
  *(Horizontal Pod Autoscaler manifest using autoscaling/v1 with CPU requests defined.)*
- `deployment-green.yaml`  
  *(Optional blue-green deployment manifest for advanced deployment strategies.)*

**Submission Instructions for Level 1:**
- Package the mandatory files into a ZIP file or provide a link to a Git repository.
- Ensure the file names match exactly as listed above.
- If you implemented bonus features, include the bonus files as well.
- Include a cover sheet or README describing your implementation and any challenges encountered.

### **Level 2: Package Management, Version Control & CI/CD**

**Objective:**
- Package your Kubernetes manifests as a Helm chart.
- Manage your code using Git with a clear branching strategy.
- Automate the build, test, and deployment process using GitHub Actions.

**Mandatory Files to Submit:**
- **Helm Chart Directory** (include all files in the following structure):
  - `Chart.yaml`  
    *(Metadata for your Helm chart.)*
  - `values.yaml`  
    *(Default configuration values.)*
  - `templates/deployment.yaml`  
    *(Templated Kubernetes deployment manifest.)*
  - `templates/service.yaml`  
    *(Templated Kubernetes service manifest.)*
- **Git Repository Submission:**  
  - Provide a link to your Git repository (or a ZIP file of your repository) including documentation of your branching strategy.
- **GitHub Actions Workflow File:**  
  - `.github/workflows/ci-cd.yml`  
    *(Defines your CI/CD pipeline to build the Docker image and deploy using Helm.)*

**Bonus Files (Optional):**
- Any additional configuration files that enhance your CI/CD pipeline (e.g., configurations for canary releases or automated rollbacks).
- Documentation explaining how the bonus enhancements were implemented.

**Submission Instructions for Level 2:**
- Provide your Git repository link or a ZIP file containing your repository, ensuring that the Helm chart and CI/CD workflow file are included.
- Include documentation that explains your Git workflow and CI/CD process.

### **Level 3: GitOps & Monitoring**

**Objective:**
- Implement GitOps by using ArgoCD to continuously deploy your application.
- Set up monitoring with Prometheus, Alertmanager, and Grafana.

**Mandatory Files to Submit:**
- `argo-app.yaml`  
  *(ArgoCD application manifest linking your Git repository to your deployment.)*
- `prometheus.yml`  
  *(Configuration for Prometheus to scrape metrics from your application pods.)*
- `alertmanager.yml`  
  *(Configuration for Alertmanager to define alert routes and receivers.)*
- **Grafana Dashboard Exports/Screenshots:**  
  *(Optional but recommended; provide JSON exports or screenshots of your dashboards.)*
- Documentation explaining your GitOps and monitoring setup.

**Bonus Files (Optional):**
- `prometheus-rules.yml`  
  *(Custom Prometheus alert rules.)*
- Any additional manifests or configuration files for enhanced monitoring (e.g., updated HPA configuration).
- Documentation describing your advanced monitoring setup.

**Submission Instructions for Level 3:**
- Package and submit the above YAML files, dashboard exports/screenshots (if applicable), and documentation.
- Clearly label your mandatory and bonus components.

### **Level 4: Cloud (AWS EC2 & Terraform)**

**Objective:**
- Provision cloud infrastructure (an EC2 instance) using Terraform.
- Deploy your sample application to AWS using Infrastructure as Code (IaC).

**Mandatory Files to Submit:**

  *(Terraform configuration that provisions an EC2 instance.)*
- Documentation (and/or screenshots) showing successful provisioning of the EC2 instance.

**Bonus Files (Optional):**
- `advanced.tf`  
  *(Additional Terraform configuration for a more advanced architecture.)*
- An updated architecture diagram showing the enhanced infrastructure.
- A bonus report explaining your design decisions and cost optimization strategies.

**Submission Instructions for Level 4:**
- Submit your Terraform configuration file(s) along with documentation confirming the successful deployment.
- Include bonus files and diagrams if you implemented the bonus assignment.

## General Submission Instructions

- **File Naming & Structure:**  
  Ensure all files are named exactly as listed above. Use the provided directory structure for clarity.

- **Packaging:**  
  You may either submit a link to your Git repository (with a well-organized commit history and documentation) or compress your project folder into a ZIP file named `DevOps_Final_Project_<YourName>.zip`.

- **Documentation:**  
  Include a README file that summarizes your work, the challenges encountered, and any bonus features implemented. Also, include architecture diagrams and screenshots where applicable.
